This package contains an implementation of the [RDF/JS Store](https://rdf.js.org/stream-spec/#store-interface) with support for quoted triples.
It works in both JavaScript and TypeScript.

If using TypeScript, it is recommended to use this in conjunction with [`@rdfjs/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rdfjs/types).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install rdf-star-stores
```
or
```bash
$ yarn add rdf-star-stores
```

This package also works out-of-the-box in browsers via tools such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [browserify](http://browserify.org/).
